ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Claudio Valletta, a Computer Scientist. 
I obtained a Ph.D. in Computational Astrophysics at the University of Zurich, in the Institute for Computational Scientist under the supervision of Professor Ravit Helled. 

I published 5 papers in the best peer reviewed journals of Astrophysics:
- [Possible in situ formation of Uranus and Neptune via Pebble Accretion](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac5f52).
- [A low accretion efficiency of planetesimals formed at planetary gap edges](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202142391).
- [An Approximation for the Capture Radius of Gaseous Protoplanets](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnrasl/slab089).
- [Giant planet formation models with a self-consistent treatment of the heavy elements](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aba904).
- [The distribution of heavy-elements in giant protoplanetary atmospheres: the importance of planetesimal-envelope interactions](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf427).

During my Ph.D. I have gained expertise in:
